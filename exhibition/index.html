    <h2>Curatorial Statement</h2>
    <p>
      The internet is a space of infinite reinvention, where identities are curated, aesthetics are amplified, and digital expressions of femininity take on new forms. "Glitch & Glitter: A Celebration of Digital Femmes" explores how artists use the web as a medium to construct, deconstruct, and reclaim notions of beauty, identity, and community. The selected works examine hyper-femininity, online personas, and the performative nature of digital spaces. From nostalgic pixel art to distorted selfies and subversive hyperpop aesthetics, this exhibition highlights how net artists reimagine femininity through interactivity, color, and code. Together, these pieces celebrate the internet as a stage for self-expression, resistance, and reinvention.
